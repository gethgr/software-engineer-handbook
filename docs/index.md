# Welcome to Software Engineer Handbook

Welcome to the **Software Engineer Handbook**, a practical guide containing a collection of must-know commands and tips for various tools commonly used in software engineering.

This repository provides quick references for everyday tools and commands used in modern development workflows. It is specifically designed for developers working with Python, Django, testing frameworks, task queues, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Git, and more.

## Project Overview

This project is intended to be a comprehensive, self-contained collection of helpful commands, configuration tips, and resources, structured into several categories. Each category covers tools or libraries that are vital to the development process, especially in the context of **Python-based** web development.

## Categories

The handbook is organized into the following categories:

- **`Git`**: Version control for managing source code.
- **`Django`**: Python web framework for backend development.
- **`PostgreSQL`**: Relational database system often used with Django.
- **`Pytest`**: Python testing framework for unit and functional tests.
- **`Docker`**: Platform for containerization and deployment.
- **`Celery`**: Asynchronous task queue for background tasks.
- **`RabbitMQ`**: Message broker for communication between services.
- **`Redis`**: In-memory data store for caching and queue management.
- **`Poetry`**: Dependency management tool for Python projects.
- **`CI/CD`**: Automation of build, test, and deployment processes.
- **`Linux`**: Command-line and system management for development.
